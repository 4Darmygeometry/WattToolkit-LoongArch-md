### Special Requirements for Building LoongArch64 Version
The LoongArch64 version of Watt Toolkit only supports building on LoongArch64 physical machines with LSX, such as Loongson 3A5000 and above; or using X86 Linux to cross compilated dotnet 9. The building principles follow the [Software Development and Build Convention for LoongArch‚Ñ¢ Architectures](https://github.com/loongson/la-softdev-convention).
The LoongArch64 version only builds the New World version.
- System requirements
	- [AOSC OS 12 or higher is required](https://aosc.io/download)
	- loongnix 25 or higher is required
	- [Deepin 25 or higher is required](https://www.deepin.org/zh/download/)
	- Yongbao 2.9 or higher is required
	- [Alpine Linux 3.21.0 or higher is required](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/)
	- [GXDE OS 15.14.2 or higher is required](https://www.gxde.top/)
	- [Debian 13 or higher is required](https://www.debian.org/)
- Work load
	- .NET version
		- [.NET 9.0 and above](https://github.com/loongson-community/dotnet-unofficial-build)
	- vscodium
		- [vscodium 1.96.2.24355 and above](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)
	- Web and Cloud
		- ASP.NET and Web Development
	- Desktop applications
		- .NET desktop development

### Due to the fact that the new world NuGet has not yet been fully upstreamed, the LoongArch64 version of this project uses the NuGet source provided by [Loongson Open Source Community](https://nuget.loongnix.cn) to provide SkiaSharp, HarfBuzzSharp, etc. This also allows compatibility with the three old world distributions: Loongnix 20, UOS 20, and Kylin.
### Users of the LoongArch64 in the old world can download the .NET 9 and later versions from the [Loongson Open Source Community](https://www.loongnix.cn/zh/api/dotnet/) to compile this project. For common issues, please refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.loongnix.cn/dotnet/support/list/01.%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98-FAQ.html#%E9%BE%99%E8%8A%AFnuget%E6%BA%90%E7%9A%84%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95).
### When compiling this project for users of the new world architecture, there is a possibility of incorporating old world binary files. It is recommended to install the [liblol old world compatibility tool](https://liblol.aosc.io) to ensure normal compilation and operation. AOSC OS, Deepin 23, and Yongbao generally come with liblol preinstalled, so no additional installation is required.
